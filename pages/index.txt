**Research Interest**

I am interested in computer vision, machine learning, and
Bayesian inference. At the moment, I am focusing on scaling Gaussian processes with applications to computer vision systems. I
am also fascinated about understanding the geometry and topology of
high dimensional machine learning problems. For more of my recent musings, check out `my research blog <http://research-caoy.blogspot.ca>`_.

**About Me**

I'm a Ph.D. student in the computer vision group of the department of Computer Science at
University of Toronto. My supervisors are `David Fleet <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/>`_ and `Aaron
Hertzmann (at Adobe research now)
<http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/>`_. You can reach me via email: caoy at cs dot
toronto dot edu, or find me in Pratt-263.

`Generalized Product of Experts for Automatic and Principled Fusion of Gaussian Process Predictions <http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7827>`_

Cao, Y., `Fleet, D.J. <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/>`_

*Modern Nonparametrics 3: Automating the Learning Pipeline workshop at NIPS*, Montreal, 2014.

*In this work, we propose a generalized product of
experts (gPoE) framework for combining the predictions of multiple
probabilistic models. We identify four desirable properties that are important for
scalability, expressiveness and robustness, when learning and
inferring with a combination of multiple models. Through analysis and experiments,
we show that gPoE of Gaussian processes (GP) have these qualities, while no other existing combination schemes satisfy
all of them at the same time. The resulting GP-gPoE is highly scalable as individual GP experts can be
independently learned in parallel; very expressive as the way 
experts are combined depends on the input rather than fixed;
the combined prediction is still a valid probabilistic model with
natural interpretation; and finally robust to unreliable predictions
from individual experts.*

`Efficient Optimization for Sparse Gaussian Process Regression <http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6007>`_

Cao, Y., `Brubaker, M. <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbrubake/>`_,
`Fleet, D.J. <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/>`_ and `Hertzmann, A <http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/>`_. 

*Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)*, Lake Tahoe, 2013. 

*We propose an efficient optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective, either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-of-art performance in discrete cases and competitive results in the continuous case.*

**Course Projects**

Sequential Decision Making For Vision Tracking

Final project for CSC2534: Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Winter 2013)

*In this project, we propose a formulation of vision tracking under sequential the
decision making frameworks of Markov decision process (MDP) and partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). From a very simple basic tracker,
we build an interactive tracking algorithm that is capable of robustly track targets
over long sequences, while still being as autonomous as it can be. We study the
effect of uncertainty of state information, and the impact of active observation
gathering versus passive observation under the framework.*

A Bayesian Approach to Modeling Social Conversation Groups

Final project for CSC2541: Topics in Machine Learning: Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning (Winter 2011)

*Constraints in social interaction is valuable prior information for detecting or tracking people in computer vision. This project proposes a probabilistic model of spatial relations among people in social events where conversation groups form. The model is based on very intuitive principles behind  how people socialize, and it can reproduce a number of the observed phenomena. By using MCMC, one can infer the true position and orientation of people as well as conversation group memberships given observation. Finally, a framework in which the model could facilitate tracking multiple interacting people is discussed.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Appearance Model Based On Transforming Autoencoders For Vision Tracking

Final project for CSC2535: Advanced Machine Learning (Winter 2011)

*In this project, transforming autoencoder is used to build an
appearance model that captures parts and spatial relationships
among parts of target objects for vision tracking. 
With a very limited motion model, and basic particle filtering,
the resulting tracker is able to track target MNIST digit in the presence of distractors with
diï¬€erent or similar appearance.*
