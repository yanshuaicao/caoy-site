We introduce a framework for analyzing transductive combination of Gaussian process (GP) experts, where independently trained GP experts are combined in a way that depends on test point location, in order to scale GPs to big data. The framework provides some theoretical justification for the generalized product of GP experts (gPoE-GP) which was previously shown to work well in practice but lacks theoretical basis. Based on the proposed framework, an improvement over gPoE-GP is introduced and empirically validated.

*Modern Nonparametrics 3: Automating the Learning Pipeline workshop at NIPS*, Montreal, 2014.

*In this work, we propose a generalized product of
experts (gPoE) framework for combining the predictions of multiple
probabilistic models. We identify four desirable properties that are important for
scalability, expressiveness and robustness, when learning and
inferring with a combination of multiple models. Through analysis and experiments,
we show that gPoE of Gaussian processes (GP) have these qualities, while no other existing combination schemes satisfy
all of them at the same time. The resulting GP-gPoE is highly scalable as individual GP experts can be
independently learned in parallel; very expressive as the way 
experts are combined depends on the input rather than fixed;
the combined prediction is still a valid probabilistic model with
natural interpretation; and finally robust to unreliable predictions
from individual experts.*
